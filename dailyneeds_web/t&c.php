and is generated as a range based on average cost and pricing information available to DailyNeeds through its
website or mobile applications and services and other means. Actual costs may differ from those derived because of
local cost differences, site specific project issues or varying market rates. The estimate obtained using any Estimator
service does not give rise to any commitment on DailyNeeds or DailyNeeds Tradespeople.

enquiry from DailyNeeds Tradespeople directly. While we will do our best, we do not guarantee that we will be able

applications and services, multiple Suppliers or Tradespeople may be provided with your contact information and
may make contact. Buyers or Users may choose which contact details they allow to be provided to Suppliers or

                <p>6.2 Contacting Buyers or Users: By providing this information to us, or by submitting a job request, you are

emails. For complete details on our use of your information, please see our privacy policy.
</p>
                <p>6.3 Accuracy: You undertake that all information you provide will be accurate, current and correct. If you provide any
information that is found to be inaccurate, untrue, or false, or if DailyNeeds has reasonable grounds to suspect that
such information is inaccurate, untrue or false, DailyNeeds has the right to refuse any current or future use of the

</p>
                <p>6.4 Indemnity: To knowingly input false information, including but not limited to name, phone number, address or
email address is a very serious and fraudulent matter that could result in significant costs and damages including
invasion of privacy rights, to DailyNeeds and its Suppliers or Tradespeople, and to consumers as well as the loss of
time, effort and expense responding to and pursuing such false information and request, and further, could result in
regulatory fines and penalties. Accordingly, if you knowingly input false information in a job or service request,

				<h3 class="headline margin-top-35 margin-bottom-15">7. Fees and Accounts
</h3>
				<p>7.1 Fees:</p>
				<p>7.1.1 Free Registration: Becoming a Buyer, User, Supplier or Tradesperson is free. DailyNeeds charges Suppliers or
Tradespeople a fee when they successfully bid for a job generated through the DailyNeeds website or mobile
applications and services. The website or mobile applications and services is completely free to Buyers or Users.</p>
				<p>7.1.2 Fees:
</p>
				<p>(a) DailyNeeds current fees are listed on our Fees Page on the website. Any fee payable to DailyNeeds will be
invoiced to the Supplier or Tradesperson by DailyNeeds and payable within the period indicated on the invoice.
DailyNeeds reserves the right to request documentation from Buyers or Users, Suppliers or Tradespeople to
demonstrate the value of a completed job. DailyNeeds will credit success fees paid on jobs where the Supplier or
Tradesperson can demonstrate, within a reasonable length of time of the invoice issue date, which payment was not
received from the Buyer or User due to no fault on their part.
</p>
				<p>(b) All jobs posted on DailyNeeds must be for specific tasks/work to be completed. Jobs which are posted that
contain non-specific details (including advertising or recruitment) may be subject to additional charges at the
discretion of DailyNeeds. If there is any intention to recruit or hire staff, employ or contract services on a full time,
part time, permanent, fixed term or casual basis or engage with a contractor over an extended period of time for
work that would not normally be considered routine (i.e. lawn mowing) then the User must post a Listing.</p>
				<p>(c) DailyNeeds reserves the right to change the fees charged for any of our services at any time. In the event that we
introduce a new Service, the fees for that Service are effective at the launch of the Service, unless otherwise stated.
</p>
				<p>(d) All fees are exclusive of GST and are New Zealand Dollars unless otherwise stated.
</p>
				<p>(e) Before chasing a job, you should review DailyNeeds fees to ensure you are aware of the fees that you will incur.</p>
				<p>(f) DailyNeeds reserves the right to take action against you to recover outstanding debt. You are liable for all
expenses (including but not limited to court costs, legal fees, collection agency fees, and a $30 administrative fee)
that DailyNeeds incurs in collecting that debt.
</p>
				<p>(g) All fees charged by DailyNeeds are to be considered a cost of business and are not to be passed on directly to the
Buyer or User through a quote. DailyNeeds is a means of marketing a business and should be treated as such in
regards to fees. Directly charging the fee through an invoice will result in the supplier or tradesperson's account
being terminated.</p>
				<p>7.2 Account termination: In the event that you terminate your account, success and other fees remain payable. This
applies to success fees that are generated after account termination, but are the result of successful connections
through DailyNeeds before the account was terminated.</p>
				<p>7.3 Credit/Debit Card Services: A credit/debit card service is provided to allow Suppliers or Tradespeople to pay for
fees associated with securing work (success fees) and also for an optional (Pro Membership) subscription service if
and when made available. Suppliers or Tradespeople may be required to provide a valid credit or debit card before
they can chase new jobs. You can contact us regarding any credit or debit card issues or questions.
</p>
				<p>7.3.1 Currency: All fees are in New Zealand dollars (NZD). The Fees Page describes these fees plus any GST payable.
Payments made from non NZ credit cards will be charged in New Zealand dollars.
</p>
				<p>7.3.2 Terms of payment (success, holding and shortlist fees): Our success, shortlist and holding fee invoices have
payment terms as described on the invoice. For success fees we invoice when the work is secured (not when the
work starts or finishes). Success fee are due and payable even if your Pro membership expires. A credit will be
applied to the Suppliers or Tradespersons accounts if success fee payments have been received, but the job can be
demonstrated to have been both cancelled and not started.</p>
				<p>7.3.3 Pro Membership is paid for on a subscription basis in advance. Refunds will not be given. DailyNeeds does not
guarantee that any Supplier or Tradespeople will have access to any particular job, or that Suppliers or Tradespeople
will secure work from the leads they are allocated. If you setup an online agreement to pay us on a regular basis, we
will automatically take payment three (3) days before the renewal date of your Pro membership. 14 days prior to
that the renewal billing date an invoice may and should be generated which may be viewed online. You may cancel
your agreement at any time. DailyNeeds will not be responsible to you or any third party for any losses or costs that
may result or arise out of you not updating or cancelling your agreement prior to the renewal date. From time to
time DailyNeeds may change its Pro Membership prices. Provided we give you 14 days’ notice of a pricing change, if
you do not cancel before your scheduled renewal you have agreed to the new price. You agree that having a Pro
membership does not remove DailyNeeds right to Limit or terminate your services. You agree that DailyNeeds has
the right to change the features of Pro Membership.</p>
				<p>7.3.4 Overdue accounts: You agree you are responsible for paying our invoices within the payment terms of the
invoice. If your account has an invoice which is overdue your account will be automatically restricted. Past due
balances will be subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month.</p>
				<p>7.3.5 Credits or refunds: Credits or refunds for fees may occasionally be offered in other circumstances at the
discretion of DailyNeeds.</p>
				<p>7.3.6 Receiving invoices: You agree to receive all invoices by email to the email address you have given to us. It is
your responsibility to ensure that this email address is working correctly.</p>
				<p>7.3.7 Queries: If you have a question about a charge on your credit or debit card, you agree to contact us using the
form available on our contact page.</p>
				<p>7.3.8 Payment failure: Should any payment method you use fail or later be reclaimed by the bank or card issuer you
agree to pay any costs incurred by us plus a $5 + GST administration fee.</p>
				<p>7.3.9 Fraud: While DailyNeeds has systems in place to reduce the risk of credit/debit card fraud, DailyNeeds is not
responsible for protecting Suppliers or Tradespeople and Buyers or Users from credit card fraud. DailyNeeds fraud
protection systems may from time to time block legitimate credit card payments. In these cases payment will need
to be made by other means.</p>
				<p>7.3.10 Authorisation: You must be authorised by the company or individual for which you are creating an account.
Unauthorised registration of a company or individual which you do not have permission will be considered
fraudulent behaviour, which may result in regulatory fines, penalties and/or referring the matter to the police.
</p>
				<p>7.3.11 DailyNeeds uses payment services providers to hold and process your credit/debit card. DailyNeeds has the
ability to charge your credit/debit card held by our payment services providers. All fees are charged to your card on
the due date of the invoice.</p>
				<p>7.3.11 Credit/Debit card contact: For any credit/debit card related issues we suggest contacting us via our contact us
link. </p>
